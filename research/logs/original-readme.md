# Copper Scroll (3Q15): hiding places and Greek letters

Identify the places and specific locations described in the Copper Scroll using editions, archaeological reports, maps, surveys and photographs. Compare named sites and individual features, then test the scroll's directions, distances and depths against candidate locations. Record the source, assumptions, confidence and positional uncertainty for each proposal.

Research workflow: [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).

This folder contains the geographical research workstream. The repository's `CLAUDE.md` also describes the DSS letter-recogniser workstream.

## Phases

1. **Master table of all entries** (done, session 1; see `phase1_summary.md`)
2. **Landmark lexicon:** Bible, Mishnah, Josephus, Eusebius (done, session 2; see `phase2_summary.md`)
3. **Site candidates:** scored against written criteria and mapped at site level (done, session 2; see `phase3_summary.md`)
4. **Greek letters:** occurrences and tests of the hypotheses (done, session 2; see `phase4_summary.md`)
5. **Archaeology check** of the Phase 3 places, published reports only (done, session 2; see `phase5_summary.md`)

## Current site assessment

The [2026-09-28 site identification review](../sites/site_identification_review.md) updates Phase 5. It returns Siloam to medium overall confidence, records the full Szanton 2023 source, and distinguishes site compatibility from identification of a particular feature. The revised Phase 5 summary and index contain the current verdicts; the Phase 3 files retain their original assessment.

The [feature investigation](../sites/feature_investigation.md) adds five feature comparisons, a source-dependency audit, separate reading/site/feature judgments, and prepared specialist and non-invasive field-observation packets. The [constraint register](../../tables/feature_constraints.csv) records the tests that could distinguish or weaken each proposal. No exact feature or deposit has been identified.

The [Qumran reference review](../sites/qumran_reference_review.md) locates Ilan–Amit’s aqueduct chapter and Hebrew figure index, records the registered-access barrier, and compares entries 20–24. The atlas now includes nine evidence reviews. The [Ilan–Amit plan review](../sites/ilan_amit_1989_plan_review.md) now examines the recovered Hebrew plan. The [research log](../../registration/qumran_online_followup.json) tracks subsequent source access; the [Humbert–Chambon review](../../registration/humbert_english_extracted.md) separates inlet phases and reconstructed channels. Specific feature matches and geographic registration remain open research questions.

The [plate check](../text/plate_check.md) (29 September 2026) tests 30 disputed lines against Puech's plates:

- Siloam (49) leans to Puech's cursive waw.
- Doq (31) leans to *hmšṭḥ*.
- IX 7 leans to ים.
- Milik's Bethesda reading needs an emendation.

No site confidence changes. The recovered *ʿAtiqot* 41 names V/48 as V/49's neighbour for entry 17 ([review](../sites/entry17_cave_pair_review.md)).

The [entry 40 review](../sites/entry40_bethhoron_review.md) adds Upper Beth-Horon as a possible, low-confidence place. It also records that Milik himself preferred the Horite tombs near Beit Guvrin in 1960, and re-checks the Phase 3 name tests against Elitzur's corpus.

The [source leads of 29 September 2026](../sources/source_leads_2026-09-29.md) locate the reports missing in Phase 5 (Q32). They also record three uploads: Stacey 2007 on the Qumran aqueducts (read in full) and Zertal's *Manasseh Hill Country Survey* Vols. 2–4 (Ibziq read in Vol. 2). Stacey's phasing is recorded as a constraint for entry 21; its confidence does not change. The [Stacey 2007 review](../sites/qumran_stacey2007_review.md) gives his construction sequence in detail, with a check of his citations of the 2002 book.

The [entry 59 review](../sites/entry59_bezek_review.md) reads Zertal's survey and *HA* 40. Neither Kh. Ibziq site has a reported conduit. On Zertal's survey alone, Kh. Ibziq was first lowered from medium to low. A 1971 excavation (*HA* 40 p. 22) then showed a kokhim tomb of the 1st–2nd centuries CE there, so Kh. Ibziq stays medium. Kh. Salhab (Zertal's biblical Bezeq) is added to the atlas as a low alternative. The Phase 5 index and summary carry the result. [sources.md](../sources/sources.md#sources-checked-2026-09-29-second-batch) records where the remaining reports can be found.

The [source extractions of 29 September 2026](../sources/source_extractions_2026-09-29.md) (second run) read Magen's NEAEHL entry on Gerizim, Garbrecht & Peleg 1994 on the desert fortresses, Zissu 2023, *HA* 40 on Ibziq, and Jeremias and DJD III for entry 40. The Hyrcania chapter (Patrich 2002) and Ilan & Amit 2002 p. 385 were read only in snippets or as word searches. Gerizim's steps and cistern are Hellenistic and stood as ruins after about 110 BCE (Q47 answered). No site confidence changes; the extraction files are in `registration/`. A third run of the same prompts is kept in `registration/extractions_run3/` and compared there: it adds a Hasmonean garrison on Gerizim into the 70s BCE and the dates of Hyrcania's two aqueducts, with no confidence changes.

The [deeper analysis of 30 September 2026](../text/deeper_analysis_2026-09-30.md) tests the order of the entries from the text alone, with code in [`deep_analysis/`](../../deep_analysis/README.md). From entry 20 on, entries that name the same place stand together; in entries 1–19 they do not. In 1–19, "north" occurs only in the Koḥlit and ha-Melaḥ entries, and every Koḥlit entry in the scroll says "north". The phrase כתבן אצלם always follows "vessels of offering", which favours Puech's and Lefkovits's division at Q5. The report takes these results as support for H8 (entries 1–19 come from a separate list) and for ha-Melaḥ as a named place in the Jericho district, not the Temple Esplanade. The Greek-letter gaps mark no change. The analysis identifies no site and changes no site confidence.

The [follow-up to the sequence model](../text/sequence_model_followup_2026-09-30.md) (30 September 2026) credits the regional order of the list to Puech (pp. 173–174). Its walking-route test finds that the order is efficient across the scroll but is not a route inside the Jericho block. The [tests on old surveys and plans](../sites/leads_on_old_plans_2026-09-30.md) take the deeper analysis to the *Survey of Western Palestine*, Warren's plans and the editions. Lefkovits (2000, p. 183) already proposed ha-Melaḥ as the City of Salt near Secacah. On Warren's Plate VI, no recorded cistern lies 19 cubits from the Golden Gate (entry 9; the nearest is 30 m away; [figure](../../figures/entry9_golden_gate_plateVI.webp)), so the feature match fails, but the Temple placement stays. Tank No. 8, the "Great Sea", is a possible, low candidate for entry 3. No site confidence changes; the findings are F12.1–F12.7 in the [findings log](findings_log.md).

## Master table columns

- `entry_puech`: Puech's entry number (1–60, plus 12a). Puech and Lefkovits use the same boundaries, so the numbers coincide.
- `item_lefkovits`: Lefkovits's item number.
- `item_milik`: Milik's item number(s), from Milik 1960 (ADAJ 4–5, pp. 139–142). "(only the closing ובתכן/בתכן phrase)" marks where Milik's item begins with the last words of the Puech entry.
- `col_line`: scroll column:line range.
- `hebrew_puech`: Puech's text (pp. 208–216) with his sigla:
  - `[ ]` lacuna/restoration
  - `[[ ]]` letter supplied by the editor
  - `< >` letter inserted by the engraver (also used here for letters written above or below the line)
  - `{ }` letter cancelled by the engraver
  - `x(y)` engraved x is an error for y
  - `a/b` alternative readings
  - `(?)` uncertain
  - ‖ line break
  - Numerals appear as `‹value›`.
- `variants_lefkovits`: hand-checked differences between Lefkovits's text and Puech's. "subst." marks a difference in place, direction, distance/depth or quantity.
- `variants_milik1962_firsthand`: hand-checked differences between Milik's own text in DJD III (1962, pp. 284–299) and Puech's. Each difference is marked "subst." (a different word, sense or figure), "orth." (spelling only) or "restor." (only in a lacuna or restoration).
- `readings_wolters1994_firsthand`: the few readings Wolters gives in his 1994 article, from his own examination of the metal, with page (F2.10).
- `variants_milik_secondhand`, `variants_wolters_secondhand`: readings that differ from Puech, as reported by Lefkovits `[Lef. p.]` (Hebrew script) or Puech `[Puech p. n.]` (transliteration). The two reporters sometimes disagree about what Milik or Wolters read.
- `translation_puech2015_en`: Puech's own English translation, from *The Copper Scroll Revisited* (2015, pp. 121–144). It already includes his corrigenda to the 2006 edition. Line numbers glued to figures in the PDF were separated by script and checked against his numerals.
- `translation_en`: an English rendering written for this project. It follows Puech's reading and his French interpretation, and is not Puech's English translation, which contains errors (see the findings log).
- `landmark_terms`, `direction_distance_depth`, `treasure`: structured from Puech's text. In the treasure column, "ככ" is kept as written. Puech and Lefkovits read it as k(esef) k(arsh), 1 karsh = 10 shekels; Milik and Allegro read "talents".
- `numerals_puech`: the value of each numeral group in Puech's reading.
- `greek_letters`: Puech's reading, and Lefkovits's where it differs.
- `damage_uncertainty_notes`: lines with lacunae, "(?)", engraver's corrections, and insertions or editorial additions, plus notes on letters above or below the line.
- `division_notes`: how other editors divide or number the entry, with source pages.
- `hebrew_lefkovits`, `translation_lefkovits`: Lefkovits's text and translation, read from the scanned images.
- `hebrew_milik1962`: Milik's Hebrew text from DJD III, line by line, as printed. It keeps his item numbers `(n)` and his brackets. ׄ (a dot above) marks a probable letter and ֯ (a circle above) a possible letter; `^…^` marks letters written above the line and `_…_` letters written below it. A line shared by two entries is given in full in both.
- `translation_milik1962_fr`: Milik's French translation from DJD III (pp. 285–298), by his item number, with page.
- `readings_milik1960_firsthand`: Milik's readings (Latin transliteration, no diacritics) as he states them in his 1960 commentary, pp. 143–155, with page.
- `translation_milik1960`: Milik's own English translation (ADAJ 1960, pp. 139–142), with his italics (*…*) marking uncertain renderings. His Hebrew readings are not given there.
- `pages_puech`, `pages_lefkovits`: printed pages of the text and commentary.
- `n_*`: counts used for the clarity ranking. `n_milik1962_differences` and `n_milik1962_substantive` count the DJD III differences.

## Method in brief

- **Puech:** the Hebrew was decoded from the PDF text layer, then all 181 lines were checked visually and all 33 numeral groups checked against his own totals (p. 173).
- **Lefkovits:** his Hebrew OCR is unusable, so every Hebrew word, including every reading he quotes from other scholars, was read from page images in eight parallel passes. The automatic Puech–Lefkovits comparison was then reviewed line by line.
- **Puech's commentary:** pp. 179–206 were extracted phrase by phrase: variant readings, his verdict on each, his notes on letter shapes and damage, and place claims (kept for Phase 3).
