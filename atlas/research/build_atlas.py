specific={
'1':('Late-antique geographical tradition points north of Jericho. Wadi Nuweimeh accommodates both the northwestern springs and northeastern lower valley.','The Iron Age Achor tradition points toward the Buqeia. No reported ruin-and-steps combination decides between them.'),
'4':('Tell es-Sultan supplies a mound and a nearby cemetery. The repository retains it as one possible Kohlit candidate.','Kohlit remains unidentified. The public index maps only a subset of the proposals discussed in the full research.'),
'20':('A cairn and a dam imply different features. Puech prefers a cairn; the dam proposal must be checked independently.','The proposed Qumran dam is reconstructed. Neither it nor a particular cairn has been established as this entry’s landmark.'),
'21':('Qumran’s water system supplies a plausible conduit-head setting. Ilan–Amit’s 1989 plan puts the visible intake beside a reconstructed dam. Stacey (2007) dates the main aqueduct after the 31 BCE earthquake and makes the dam and the cliff tunnel a later stage.','The link to Sekakah and the stone noun are partly restored. Northern approach and northern side must be tested separately. Under Stacey’s phasing, the earlier channel began where the aqueduct leaves the cliff, so the head of a construction stage is an alternative to the dam intake; the phasing is a hypothesis. The pin marks the settlement.'),
'22':('Qumran’s reservoirs provide a setting to test against the fissure east of the named reservoir.','Neither the ancient reservoir name nor the specific eastern fissure has been established. Jerusalem’s similarly named pool does not relocate this entry.'),
'23':('Puech allows Shallum as an alternative to Solomon and a large boulder as the landmark. The channel’s connection to entry 22’s reservoir is conditional.','No origin or endpoint is identified for the stated distance. Entry order alone does not establish a continuous route.'),
'24':('The wording permits a regional approach test from Jericho toward Sekakah. Wadi Kuteif remains a published proposal.','The recorded rock-cut chamber is undated and does not identify the required tomb. A route from entry 23 to entry 24 is not specified.'),
'31':('A Hasmonean fortress occupied the summit, supplied by a wadi diversion, a 500 m channel and nine cisterns. The name Doq survives nearby at Ain Duk.','Editors disagree over “guard post” and “drying place.” The 2026 plate check leans to the drying place, so the fortress is not the landmark by default. The surviving name does not distinguish the summit from the spring; Q24 remains open. Garbrecht and Peleg note that Doq was apparently not rebuilt by Herod, so first-century use of the summit is not shown.'),
'40':('Under the reading “facing the Sea” (west), which the 2026 plate check favours, Beth-Horon keeps Milik’s textual basis; its name survives at Beit ʿUr, and rock-cut tombs are reported at both villages. Naṭuf rests on the order of the entries.','Milik himself later judged the Horite tombs near Beit Guvrin slightly more likely. Puech reads “south”. Jeremias dates his Beit Guvrin shaft-tomb necropolis only as Seleucid. No chamber facing west, channel or 16-cubit depth is reported anywhere.'),
'32':('Choziba preserves a related name, and the Wadi Qelt waterworks fit the outlet-and-wall description in the relevant period.','The individual outlet and retaining wall remain unidentified. The pin represents a stretch of the valley.'),
'35':('The Kidron gorge supplies the named landscape; Mar Saba and Hyrcania feature in published proposals.','“Mouth of the gorge” could also describe the escarpment exit. No cairn fixes the location; Hyrcania’s link depends on restorations.'),
'38':('The spring name and the Khareitun setting support a candidate in this district.','The required dovecote or cave feature has not been demonstrated at this spring.'),
'46':('Ramat Rahel has an earlier pool-and-channel enclosure and later settlement.','The known enclosure lay under fill containing pottery as late as the second century BCE. The current verdict is low; the required period reservoir remains unverified.'),
'48':('The standing Kidron monument has first-century architectural features.','Its earliest surviving labels name Zacharias. A first-century association with Absalom remains unestablished.'),
'49':('The tunnel outlet and surrounding pools supply a compatible water-installation setting. Szanton distinguishes the smaller Silwan pool from Birkat el-Hamra.','Siloam depends on a supplied word; the 2026 plate check shows the disputed letter as a waw-shaped stroke, which leans to Puech without deciding it. Lefkovits reads no Siloam name. The trough remains unverified; overall confidence stays medium and conditional.'),
'55':('The Bethesda complex supplies double pools and a smaller basin in the relevant period.','The smaller basin follows Milik’s and Puech’s reading לימומית; the Text tab reads “on the right”. The text may describe two pools without naming Bethesda; the 2026 plate check shows what looks like a ḥet where Milik’s Bethesda needs a taw. The nearby Strouthion twin pool prevents a unique match on that feature alone.'),
'57':('The mountain name provides the geographical anchor. Magen’s excavations found three Hellenistic staircases and a mansion with a courtyard cistern on the summit; they still stood as ruins in the first century.','The city was destroyed about 110 BCE. A Hasmonean garrison probably stayed into the 70s BCE, but nothing ties it to the steps or cistern, and no use of them is reported before the fourth century CE. Only stray coins of the first century CE were found; three from the mansion area are an open lead. No specific step or pit is identified.'),
'58':('Perennial springs and period water installations fit the regional setting at Beth Shean.','The scroll’s final mem differs from the usual nun in Beth Shean. No evidence selects the particular spring.'),
'59':('Zertal identifies Eusebius’s two villages called Bezek, 17 miles from Neapolis, with the two Ibziq sites. A kokhim tomb excavated at Kh. Ibziq in 1971 held pottery of the 1st–2nd centuries CE, which fits Puech’s alternative “burial chamber” reading in type. Zertal places the older Bezeq at nearby Kh. Salhab.','Zertal’s survey reports cisterns and burial caves but no conduit at either Ibziq site, and few Early Roman sherds on the surface. No conduit is reported at Kh. Salhab either. The place name depends on Puech’s reading הבזך, which Allegro and Lefkovits share; the Text tab shows הבור, “the cistern”, the reading of Wilmot and Wise.'),
